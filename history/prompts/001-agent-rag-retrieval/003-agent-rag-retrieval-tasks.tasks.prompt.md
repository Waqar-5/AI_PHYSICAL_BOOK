## Prompt

sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md file for the OpenAI Agent with Retrieval-Augmented Capabilities feature based on the spec.md and plan.md files. Created a comprehensive task list organized by user stories with proper dependencies and execution order.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task list for agent implementation following spec requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests created, but tasks include testing considerations
- 📁 Files: Updated plan.md and created/updated tasks.md with 28 structured tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation of tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-organized by user story for independent development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing Phase 1 tasks
