## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation tasks for the RAG frontend integration feature, organized in 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 3 user stories (P1-P3) plus Frontend Integration and Polish phases. The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
